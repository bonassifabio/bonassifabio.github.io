I'm a post-doctoral reasearcher at the Uppsala University, Sweden.
My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, dynamical system modeling and optimization-based control.

With my research activities, I try to bridge the gaps between the deep learning community and the System & Controls community, showing that the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for system indentification and MPC design can combine performances and safety.

I am also interested in the application of deep learning and optimization-based control approaches to the Power System.

#### Reconciling Deep Learning and Control Theory
As a PhD student at Politecnico di Milano, Italy, I have been investigating the use of Recurrent Neural Networks for **data-driven control** of unknown dynamical systems.
We investigated:

- The Input-to-State Stability (ISS) and Incrementally Input-to-State Stabile (ùõøISS) of RNNs.
- Training strategy for learning RNNs with stability and robustness certifications.
- RNN-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Internal Model Control (IMC) schemes. 

This ideas have been described in my [PhD dissertation](https://bonassifabio.github.io/phd-thesis/), defended on February 2023.

#### Optimization-based control for the smart grid
I am also interested in the **application of optimization-based control algorithms** in the context of the **smart grid**. 
During my research activities, I have worked on the following topics:

- Design of MPC architectures for the optimal energy management and coordination of microgrids & prosumers.
- Analysis of the European regulatory framework for the participation of prosumer aggregators in the electricity markets.
- Design of optimization-based energy management architectures for aggregators of microgrids & prosumers.
