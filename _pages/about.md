I‚Äôm a post-doctoral researcher at Uppsala University, Sweden, exploring topics at the intersection of deep learning, system identification, and (optimization-based) control.

My work aims to bridge the gaps between the deep learning and control systems communities. 
I focus on demonstrating how models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used for system identification and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve both high performance and safety.


<br/>
#### Reconciling Deep Learning and Control Theory
During my PhD at Politecnico di Milano, I investigated the use of RNNs for data-driven control of unknown dynamical systems. My research addressed:

-	Stability properties, including Input-to-State Stability (ISS) and Incremental ISS (ùõøISS) for RNNs.
- Training strategies that ensure robustness and stability.
-	Development of RNN-based MPC and Internal Model Control (IMC) schemes with theoretical guarantees.

This ideas have been described in my [PhD dissertation](https://bonassifabio.github.io/phd-thesis/), defended on February 2023.


<br/>
#### System identification meets machine learning

In my postdoctoral work, I have been exploring Structured State-Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba. My focus is on:
-	Integrating principles of system identification into SSM architectures.
-	Improving thir performance by investigating innovative parameterizations, structures, and initializations.
- Applying those models on system identification and sequence classification tasks.


<br/>
#### Optimization-based control for the smart grid
I am also interested in the application of optimization-based control algorithms to the smart grid, focusing on:
- Developing MPC frameworks for optimal energy management in microgrids.
-	Exploring European regulations for prosumer aggregators in electricity markets.
-	Designing energy management architectures for distributed resources.
