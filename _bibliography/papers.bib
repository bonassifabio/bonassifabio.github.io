  abstract = {This paper explores the use of Control Affine Neural Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous (CA-NNARX) models for nonlinear system identification and model-based control design. The idea behind this architecture is to match the known control-affine structure of the system to achieve improved performance. Coherently with recent literature of neural networks for data-driven control, we first analyze the stability properties of CA-NNARX models, devising sufficient conditions for their incremental Input-to-State Stability ({\delta}ISS) that can be enforced at the model training stage. The model’s stability property is then leveraged to design a stable Internal Model Control (IMC) architecture. The proposed control scheme is tested on a real Quadruple Tank benchmark system to address the output reference tracking problem. The results achieved show that (i) the modeling accuracy of CA-NNARX is superior to the one of a standard NNARX model for given weight size and training epochs, (ii) the proposed IMC law provides performance comparable to the ones of a standard Model Predictive Controller (MPC) at a significantly lower computational burden, and (iii) the $\delta$ ISS of the model is beneficial to the closed-loop performance. Note to Practitioners —Many engineering systems, such as robotic manipulators and chemical reactors, are described by Control Affine (CA) models, characterized by onlinear dynamics where the control variable enters in a linear way. If only this structural information is available without any additional knowledge, for instance on the order of the system or on the value of its parameters, a black-box identification approach can be followed to estimate the model from data. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a modeling and control design method suited for this class of systems. Specifically, we assume that the system is described by a CA-Neural Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous (CA-NNARX) model. Then, the estimated model is used to design a stable Internal Model Control (IMC) scheme for the solution of output reference tracking problems. The stability, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed approach are studied and tested in the control of a laboratory system. In addition, a simulation analysis shows how IMC represents a valid alternative to the popular Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, in particular for embedded systems, where the computation power required by MPC can be too high.},

In this work, we show their equivalence to a (relaxed) indirect approach, allowing us to reformulate direct methods in terms of estimated parameters and covariance matrices. This allows us to provide further insights into how these direct predictive control methods work, showing that, for unconstrained problems, the direct methods are equivalent to subspace predictive control with a reduced weight on the tracking cost, and analyzing the impact of the data length on tuning strategies. Via a numerical experiment, we also illustrate why the performance of direct DDPC methods with fixed regularization tends to degrade as the number of training samples increases.},

Indeed, while RNNs have long been known to be universal approximators of dynamical systems, their adoption for system identification and control has been limited by the lack of solid theoretical foundations. We here intend to summarize a novel approach to address this gap, which is structured in two contributions. First, a framework for learning safe and robust RNN models is devised, relying on the Incremental Input-to-State Stability ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}$\delta$ISS) notion. Then, after a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}$\delta$ISS black-box model of the plant is identified, its use for the design of model-based control laws (such as Nonlinear MPC) with closed-loop performance guarantees is illustrated.

In particular, a novel formulation is devised, which does not necessitate the onerous computation of terminal ingredients, but rather relies on the explicit definition of a minimum prediction horizon ensuring closed-loop stability. The designed methodology is particularly suited for the control of systems learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are known for their enhanced modeling capabilities and for which the incremental ISS properties can be studied thanks to simple algebraic conditions.

  abstract = {This doctoral thesis aims to establish a theoretically-sound framework for the adoption of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models in the context of nonlinear system identification and model-based control design. The idea, long advocated by practitioners, of exploiting the remarkable modeling performances of RNNs to learn black-box models of unknown nonlinear systems, and then using such models to synthesize model-based control laws, has already shown considerable potential in many practical applications. On the other hand, the adoption of these architectures by the control systems community has been so far limited, mainly because the generality of these architectures makes it difficult to attain general properties and to build solid theoretical foundations for their safe and profitable use for control design. To address these gaps, we first provide a control engineer-friendly description of the most common RNN architectures, i.e., Neural NARXs (NNARXs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), as well as their training procedure. The stability properties of these architectures are then analyzed, using common nonlinear systems' stability notions such as the Input-to-State Stability (ISS), the Input-to-State Practical Stability (ISPS), and the Incremental Input-to-State Stability (δISS). In particular, sufficient conditions for these properties are devised for the considered RNN architectures, and it is shown how to enforce these conditions during the training procedure, in order to learn provenly stable RNN models. Model-based control strategies are then synthesized for these models. In particular, nonlinear model predictive control schemes are first designed: in this context, the model's δISS is shown to enable the attainment of nominal closed-loop stability and, under a suitable design of the control scheme, also robust asymptotic zero-error output regulation. Then, an alternative computationally-lightweight control scheme, based on the internal model control strategy, is proposed, and its closed-loop properties are discussed. The performances of these control schemes are tested on several nonlinear benchmark systems, demonstrating the potentiality of the proposed framework. Finally, some fundamental issues for the practical implementation of RNN-based control strategies are mentioned. In particular, we discuss the need for the safety verification of RNN models and their adaptation in front of changes of the plant's behavior, the definition of RNN structures that exploit qualitative physical knowledge of the system to boost the performances and interpretability of these models, and the problem of designing control schemes that are robust to the unavoidable plant-model mismatch.},

Indeed, in this context, many problems arise, such as the well known Catastrophic Forgetting and Capacity Saturation ones.

  abstract={In this paper, the flexibility of hybrid AC-DC distribution networks is exploited to coordinate multiple Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with the aim of promptly restoring unexpected power imbalances caused by intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and loads. Given the potential large-scale nature of the problem, the AC distribution network is decomposed into non-overlapping areas named clusters, equipped with MicroGrids (MGs) and non-dispatchable units, and interconnected also by the DC network. Each cluster is endowed with a Model Predictive Controller designed to compensate the local active power variability by requesting balancing services to the local MGs. A supervisory layer is designed and activated to optimally transfer power through the controllable DC links guaranteeing enough operative margins to each cluster. The designed architecture is tested on a benchmark grid composed of the IEEE 37-bus and 13-bus systems, connected by a multi-terminal DC network. The reported numerical results witness the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The goal of this paper is to analyze Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks from a dynamical system perspective. The classical recursive equations describing the evolution of LSTM can be recast in state space form, resulting in a time invariant nonlinear dynamical system. In this work, a sufficient condition guaranteeing the Input-to-State (ISS) stability property of this system are provided. Then, a discussion on the verification of LSTM networks is provided; in particular, a dedicated approach based on the scenario algorithm is devised. The proposed method is eventually tested on a pH neutralization process.},

  abstract={Volatile renewable energy resources are gaining more and more diffusion throughout the power system, and their intermittent production calls for enhanced balancing efforts. With a recent regulation, the European Union endorsed the participation of aggregated microgrids to the balancing of power system. The resulting assets optimization problem, however, features privacy constraints that prevent a full exchange of information, making fully centralized approaches not suitable. To this purpose, this work proposes a hierarchical approach allowing microgrids' aggregators to provide balancing services in an efficient and privacy-friendly fashion. This approach is based on a novel method to describe the power exibility that each microgrid can provide, allowing to significantly decrease the computational effort.},

  abstract={The progressive diffusion of generation units based on intermittent renewable energy sources, as well as the increasing volatile power demand, calls for a new framework to compensate the power variability in a local fashion. In this context, the European Union instituted the figure of the Balance Responsible Party, i.e. an entity entitled of internally compensating the power uctuations, exploiting a portfolio of local dispatchable units. Considering a distribution network carrying balance responsibility, this work devises a scalable, fully distributed, multilayer control strategy for internal power balancing. The proposed scheme features multiple local MPC regulators, performing an autonomous power balancing; a supervisory layer based on Distributed Consensus ADMM is introduced to coordinate local regulators when some of them exhausts its local resources. Numerical results eventually show the effectiveness of the approach},

  abstract={Recent regulations have explicitly endorsed the provision of ancillary services by Microgrids (MGs). However, the associated technical requirements (e.g. minimum power reserve) still represent an impeding factor for most MGs given their reduced capability. For this reason, approaches to pool MGs into Aggregators, allowing to jointly coordinate MGs to fulfill such requirements, have been proposed but their practical feasibility has been not proved. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to test a previously proposed distributed day-ahead scheduling algorithm on a realistic benchmark with ABB e-mesh(TM) EMS, an industrial-grade MG energy management system. The results show that the approach can deal systematically with different MG units and controllers, maintaining its scalable and optimal performances.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an approach to the design of a controller for a system made by dynamically decoupled subsystems. Each subsystem is endowed with local actuators that, in normal operating conditions, are able to compensate for disturbances and to provide the required control action. If, due to too large disturbances, the local control action is not sufficient, the actuators of the neighbouring subsystems can provide the required control contribution. The control scheme is designed according to a hierarchical approach: at the lower layer local Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) are used to compute the required control action. The information about any shortage or excess of control is sent to a supervisor that, if needed, re-balances the local control actions to guarantee global disturbance rejection properties. A simulation example concerning the coordination of small electrical grids is discussed to show the performances of the proposed solution.},
